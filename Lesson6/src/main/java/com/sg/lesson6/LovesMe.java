/**
 *
 * @author GKB
 * 
 * Write a program that picks petals off a daisy (ordinarily 34 petals!) 
 * and prints out "It LOVES me NOT!" or "It LOVES me!" for every other 
 * petal until it runs out of petals. Feel free to print a happy message 
 * at the end too â€¦ since the result should ALWAYS be the same.
 * Did you write it in a while, or do/while loop? Why? (answer in a comment)
 * 
 * I used a while loop, as I only want it to run if there are petals on the 
 * flower.
